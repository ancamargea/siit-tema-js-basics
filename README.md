# JavaScript Homework: Handling User Input, Data Types, and Arrays

## OBJECTIVE:

Create a program that collects and processes student information using functions and arrays. This exercise will test your understanding of functions, data types, user input, arrays, and simple data manipulation.

## INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Define a function getUserInfo that:
   Asks the user for their name using prompt.
   Asks the user for their age using prompt.
   Asks the user if they are present using confirm.
   Returns an object containing:
   name: the user's name.
   age: the user's age (as a number).
   attendance: a boolean indicating whether the student is present.

2. Use this function to collect data for multiple students and store their information in an array. (3 points)

3. Create a function showAttendancePercentage that:
   Calculates the percentage of students who are present.
   Displays this percentage in an alert. (2 points)

4. Create a function createTeams that:
   Takes a number as a parameter (the desired number of teams).
   Forms teams only with present students.
   Distributes students across the teams in a structured way so that each team receives students in a cyclic order. (2 points)
   (Bonus) Shuffles the students before assigning them to teams to ensure variety. (1 point)
   For 10 present students and 3 teams required, logs in the console the teams in the following format:

TEAM 1: Student 1, Student 4, Student 7, Student 10

TEAM 2: Student 2, Student 5, Student 8

TEAM 3: Student 3, Student 6, Student 9

5. Push your work to a personal Git repository and share the link to your repository.
